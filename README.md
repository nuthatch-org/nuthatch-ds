# Nuthatch Data Service

Paid access to reproducible, self-hosted [Nuthatch](https://github.com/nuthatch-org/nuthatch)
indexed datasets on Graph Horizon.

The Arbitrum One proxy deployment is
[`0x647D…c10A`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x647D1Fd14AF2DE3947522B74F1de5B99d317c10A).
See [`deployments/arbitrum-one.json`](deployments/arbitrum-one.json) for the immutable deployment
record.

The deployed proxy currently has a 555 GRT provision floor. The repository prepares a zero-floor
soft-launch upgrade, but that is not effective on-chain until the proxy owner executes it. A
deployment record is history, not an oracle, which is why it says 555 GRT until that transaction
exists.

The unit of service is a Nuthatch nest identity, or NID. A provider advertises a
specific `(NID, QueryMode, endpoint)` offering on-chain. Consumers can therefore choose
an independently reproducible dataset, not merely a server which says that it does SQL.

```
consumer -- TAP-Receipt --> nuthatch-gateway --> private nuthatch :8288
                                  |                  /schema /q /table /sql
                                  +-- receipts -> RAV -> NuthatchDataService.collect()
```

The Solidity service is a UUPS Horizon data service. The Rust gateway is built on
[`horizon-core`](https://github.com/nuthatch-org/horizon-core), which validates TAP
receipts, rejects replayed nonces, persists receipts, aggregates RAVs, and collects them.

## Public API

The public gateway is deliberately narrow. It does not expose Nuthatch administration,
metrics, internal metadata, or its general routing surface.

```
GET /v1/nests/:nid/schema                 free discovery
GET /v1/nests/:nid/queries                free discovery
GET /v1/nests/:nid/q/:query               1 CU, TAP required
GET /v1/nests/:nid/table/:table           2 CU, TAP required
GET /v1/nests/:nid/sql?q=...              20 CU, TAP required, SQL offerings only
```

The gateway is configured with exactly one `NUTHATCH_NID`. It rejects another NID rather
than treating the path as a decorative suggestion. Run another gateway for another
offering. `NUTHATCH_QUERY_MODE=NAMED` is the default. Set it to `SQL` only for an offering
explicitly registered as `QueryMode.SQL`.

`/schema` and `/queries` are intentionally free. They are discovery metadata. The named
query surface is the normal product. Arbitrary SQL is not a public-security boundary in
Nuthatch and is deliberately opt-in.

## Build

```bash
./setup-contracts.sh
forge build && forge test
cargo test
```

`setup-contracts.sh` pins `graphprotocol/contracts` to the Horizon 1.1.0 commit. Do not
casually float it to a later Graph contracts release. The layout changed, naturally.

## Deployment and provider lifecycle

The contract is deployed on Arbitrum One, but a deployment is not a live
service. There is currently no registered provider and no settled paid query.
The first intended offering is the computed NID
`36d3c71446a56cdb5b90536d3f5f77351b1d92efcca94bc2fd41b1c368e69410` of
[`nuthatch-org/horizon-nest`](https://github.com/nuthatch-org/horizon-nest),
served in `NAMED` mode.

The on-chain lifecycle is:

```text
provision → register → startService(NID, NAMED, endpoint)
          → validate receipts → aggregate RAVs → collect()
          → stopService → deregister
```

`startService` expects:

```solidity
abi.encode(nid, INuthatchDataService.QueryMode.NAMED, "https://your-endpoint")
```

The proxy currently has its historical 555 GRT provision floor. The source has
a tested zero-floor soft-launch implementation, but UUPS means that change only
exists on-chain after the owner deploys and executes an upgrade. Do not claim a
zero provision floor before that transaction is confirmed.

### Upstream hardening

The Nuthatch runtime must be private and mounted with `sql = "allowlist"`. The
checked-in [`deployments/horizon-runtime.mounts.toml`](deployments/horizon-runtime.mounts.toml)
exposes only the five queries sanctioned by `horizon-nest` and refuses arbitrary
`/sql` and `/explain`. It is designed for the Nuthatch 2.x `[[chains]]` runtime
configuration. The systemd unit at
[`deployments/nuthatch-ds-upstream.service`](deployments/nuthatch-ds-upstream.service)
binds it to the fixed local Docker bridge and disables the Nuthatch admin UI.
The bridge address is reachable by local containers but not by the public
network. Start Compose before starting this unit, since Compose owns that
bridge.

### Gateway deployment

The provider gateway is documented in
[`crates/nuthatch-gateway/README.md`](crates/nuthatch-gateway/README.md). Its
Arbitrum One template is
[`deployments/gateway.arbitrum-one.toml.example`](deployments/gateway.arbitrum-one.toml.example).

For Docker Compose:

```bash
cp deployments/gateway.arbitrum-one.toml.example gateway.toml
chmod 600 gateway.toml
printf 'NUTHATCH_NID=36d3c71446a56cdb5b90536d3f5f77351b1d92efcca94bc2fd41b1c368e69410\n' > .env
printf 'NUTHATCH_QUERY_MODE=NAMED\n' >> .env
printf 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<high-entropy-secret>\n' >> .env
chmod 600 .env
docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build
```

For production, run Postgres with Compose and the gateway using
[`deployments/nuthatch-ds-gateway.service`](deployments/nuthatch-ds-gateway.service).
Both the gateway and upstream Nuthatch runtime bind only to loopback, and
Postgres binds only to `127.0.0.1`. A reverse proxy provides TLS and public DNS.
The gateway enforces a per-IP rate limit for all NID routes. The production
default is 10 requests per second with a burst of 20. It must remain `NAMED`
until a separate SQL offering is deliberately registered and the upstream is
reviewed for that exposure.


## Verification

The working mainnet beta and its exact checks are described in
[`docs/announcing-nuthatch-data-service.md`](docs/announcing-nuthatch-data-service.md).

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --locked
cd contracts && forge fmt --check && forge test -vvv
NUTHATCH_NID=<nid> NUTHATCH_QUERY_MODE=NAMED POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test docker compose config -q
```

The gateway tests cover malformed NIDs, case-normalised NID matching, named and
SQL mode parsing, safe upstream identifiers, pricing, and NID mismatch. The
contract suite covers registration with zero provision, offering activation,
restart/update behaviour, both query modes for one NID, invalid NIDs,
unregistered providers, stop/deregister lifecycle, payment destination defaults,
and the deliberate no-slashing policy.
